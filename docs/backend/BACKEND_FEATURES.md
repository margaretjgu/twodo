## 🏗️ **HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Perfect Implementation:**
Each module follows the same clean architecture pattern:

```
domain/          # Core business entities and interfaces
├── entities.rs  # Business objects (User, Group, Expense, etc.)
└── ports.rs     # Interfaces (repositories, services)

application/     # Business logic and use cases  
└── use_cases.rs # Service classes with business rules

infrastructure/  # External concerns
├── persistence/ # Database implementations
├── web/        # HTTP handlers  
└── crypto/     # External services
```

### **Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **Testable** - Domain logic isolated from infrastructure
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Swappable** - Can replace databases, frameworks easily
- ✅ **WASM Compatible** - Works with Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Proper error handling and validation

## 🔐 **SECURITY FEATURES**

- **Authentication required** for all operations
- **Group-based permissions** - users can only access their groups
- **Role-based authorization** (owner/admin/member permissions)
- **Input validation** on all endpoints
- **Password hashing** with salt
- **JWT token authentication**
- **Error message sanitization**

---

## 📊 **DATA RELATIONSHIPS**

```
User ←→ GroupMember ←→ Group
 ↓         ↓            ↓
Chore   Expense      Event
 ↓         ↓            ↓
Comment  ExpenseShare  EventAttendee
```

### **Cross-Feature Integration:**
- **Groups** are the foundation - all activities happen within groups
- **Events** can link to chores (deadline reminders) and expenses (event costs)
- **Expenses** can be linked to events (party costs, trip expenses)
- **Chores** can have calendar events for deadline tracking
